== Changes Made from PublicEarth Web Site (www project)

* Added Category.to_json method
* Fixed bug with renaming the Rails Inflector to ActiveSupport::Inflector (base.rb line 107):

  def schema_name
    self.name =~ /::([^:]*)$/ && $1 && ActiveSupport::Inflector.underscore($1) || nil
  end

* Connections are pooled now in Rails, so removed the saving of the connection with the PublicEarth::Db::Base class:

  def connection
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection
  end

* Removed PublicEarth::Db::Base.connection= method, as connections are pooled.

* Created a PublicEarth::Db::Developer class (SQL scripts are in the www project).

* Added plist functionality (initializer, base.rb, category.rb)

* Added to_cache method to PublicEarth::Db::Category (later replaced by "ontology")

* Took category "head" out of the place JSON.  Moved data formats to their own extension file.

* Changed "tags" to "keywords" in the place JSON and XML output.

* Added to_xml, to_json, and to_plist to details.

* Read-only place details.

* Load place from search document results.

* Cache categories, attribute definitions by name in memcached.

* Added wiki_as_html, wiki_as_text, and apply_formatting to Details, so clients may indicate the formatting to return for place details.  Created a RedCloth formatter to strip wiki tags and return pure text.

* Passing Details reference to each attribute, so it can refer back to its details.  For formatting, but useful across the board in a variety of situations.

* Category ontology method.
